# AutostartAfterPing

## Instructions
Customize and use this batch script to start programs automatically after successfully pinging a specific server.

* Used with a public server (www.google.de) it will start the programs once the internet is available.
* Used with a private server it will start the programs once the intranet/VPN is available.

## Background / Motivation
Nowadays it's annoying for "mobile workers" to have several autostarting 
programs needing an internet, intranet or VPN connection. Often the 
autostart of these programs is processed before a network connection is 
established. 
These programs are annoying and error prone by displaying login dialogs 
and error messages that are stealing the focus while you are trying to
enter a password for the WLAN or VPN Client.
